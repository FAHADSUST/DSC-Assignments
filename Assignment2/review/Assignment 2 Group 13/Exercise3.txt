Exercise 3:
------------------
Answer the following questions:
------------------
1. Why do events require their occurrence time to be included? In which cases is it important?
Provide an example.
------------------
Answer 1:    Occurence time of events are quite critical as these are required to analyze data and to come-up with meaning full analysis. Comparision of event's occurence time is an important factor as well.


===========================================
2. Why do some events require spatial properties? (When is that used, provide examples).
------------------
Answer 2:     Spatial properties are required to have geographical locations and/or spatial extents such as point coordinates, lines, or polygons which can be the critial information in some cases.
GPS applications are quite good example of it as they send events containing information about location.


===========================================
3. A data stream can contain punctuations. Define what punctuations are, and give an example of how they can be used. 
------------------
Answer 3:     Punctuations are included in a data stream to convey knowledge about ends of data subsets. It informs a stream processor that no tuples exist after that punctuation that satisfy its predicate.

If the bid structure is:
< itemid, increase, buyerid >
the punctuation < {1001, 2004} , * , * > describes all bids on
items 1001 and 2004.
