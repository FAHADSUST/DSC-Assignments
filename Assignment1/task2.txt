Data Streams and CEP - Assignment NÂ°01

Exercise 2: Query design.

Query 1: Output a stream of readings for all books in the room number 036.

SELECT bookID FROM (
	SELECT * FROM books AS b, (
		SELECT * FROM RFID_stream AS s, room_db AS r
		WHERE s.reader_id = r.reader_id) AS d
	WHERE b.tag_id = d.tag_id) AS c
WHERE c.room_number = 36;

Query 2: Get a stream of all books that left one room to another (taken by a person FROM one room to another) in the last 30 minutes.

SELECT bookID FROM books as d, (
	SELECT tag_id FROM (
		SELECT a.reader_ID, a.tag_id, a.timestamp, b.reader_id, b.timestamp
		FROM RFID_stream AS A [RANGE 30MIN], RFID_stream As B [RANGE 30MIN]
		WHERE a.tag_id = b.tag_id)
	WHERE a.reader_ID != b.reader_id AND a.timestamp != b.timestamp) as c
WHERE c.tag_id = d.tag_id;


Query 3: Get a stream of checked out books within the last 12 hours.

SELECT bookID
FROM books [RANGE 12HOURS]
WHERE checked_out = true;

Query 4: Return a result stream of books that were taken off shelve to a reading room and back within the last 12 hours.

SELECT bookID FROM books AS e, (
	SELECT tag_id FROM (
		SELECT a.reader_id, a.timestamp, b.reader_id, b.tag_id, b.timestamp
		FROM RFID_stream AS a [RANGE 12HOURS], (
			SELECT c.reader_id, c.tag_id, c.timestamp
			FROM RFID_stream AS c [RANGE 12HOURS],
			RFID_stream AS d [RANGE 12HOURS]
			WHERE c.tag_id = d.tag_id AND c.timestamp != d.timestamp AND c.reader_id = d.reader_id) AS b
		WHERE a.tag_id = b.tag_id )
	WHERE a.reader_id != b.reader_id AND a.timestamp < b.timestamp) AS f
WHERE e.tag_id = f.tag_id;

	

Query 5: Return a result stream of books that were taken out of the library without being checked out.

SELECT bookID FROM (
	SELECT * FROM Room_DB AS r, (
		SELECT * FROM RFID_stream AS s, books AS b
		WHERE s.tag_ID = B.tag_ID)
	AS d
	WHERE r.reader_id = d.reader_id)
WHERE Room_number = 4 AND checked_out = false;
